There is a new meme social network app called HackerMeme, and it is getting a lot of traction.

A problem the development team is encountering is that there may be several hours between a user's active sessions. The marketing team has decided to create a messaging bot that will humor the user with witty memes every 6 hours. It will also allow the user to interact with the bot to find new memes. 

Design an architecture for this bot that will send posts to the user and will allow the user to interact with it.

Components:
1. A cloud infrastructure like AWS/GCP
2. An NLP logic service
3. The backend service is in Python
4. The client is any device that has a web browser
